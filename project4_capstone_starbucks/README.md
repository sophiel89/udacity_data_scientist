The target of this project is to improve Starbucks discount campaigns for members. With transaction data provided by Starbucks a linear regression was estimated with several influencing factors for the probability of redeeming a discount offer. Paired with various descriptive analyses offers should be better targeted to reach those members most likely to redeem them.

Input Data:
    - data/portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
    - data/profile.json - demographic data for each customer
