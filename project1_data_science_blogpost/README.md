## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I used publicly available Airbnb data from Munich and Berlin to answer the following questions:

1. What are the main characteristics of Airbnb listings in Munich and Berlin?
2. Do prices for rental units differ significantly between both cities?
3. Do current government regulations and policies impact the development of Airbnb offers?
